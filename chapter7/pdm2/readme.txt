This sample demonstrates the IDL code for PDM and its mapping to
Java.  The file build.bat invokes VisiBroker's IDL to Java
converter, which produces Java source code in the subdirectory
"pdm".  Only six files are included here.  (The Holder and
Helper classes are omitted.)

For a fully functional application using this interface
definition, please see studies\pdm2 in this package.

This IDL differs from chapter5\pdm\pdm.idl in that it takes
a full exposure approach of the persistent objects.  See
description in pdm.idl for details.
