      Setup Procedure for Apache Servlet Engine "JServ"

The iBank example uses Apache web server and its servlet 
engine JServ.  You need to download and install Apache 
and JServ separately.  When installing JServ, you may
point the jsdk path to the v.2.1 one in: Studies/classes/jsdk.jar
under this package.  (The version 2.0 one required by
JServ will not work properly though.  See 
Studies/classes/readme.txt)

The setup for JServ is given below.  Here %JServ% stands
for the installation path of JServ (e.g. C:\Apache\JServ).
It should be replaced with the actual path in the file.

Also, we assume the sample code is located at
C:/ooda-sample/Studies (which means you unzipped the
package to C:/ooda-sample).  If you put the package in a 
different path, you would need to use the actual path.

Step 1. 

  Modify the file C:/ooda-sample/Studies/ooda.properties 
  so that the line:

repositories=C:/ooda-sample/Studies/  

  and 

servlets.default.initArgs=wwwroot=C:/ooda-sample/Studies

  reflects the actual path in your machine.

 
Step 2. 

  In the file %JServ%/conf/jserv.properties, add the lines below.

  (Make sure you don't have empty lines between consecutive
   wrapper.classpath= lines.  Also ensure the vbroker paths
   point to the actual one.  All are case sensitive, make
   sure your path names appear exactly as typed.)

ooda.properties=C:/ooda-sample/Studies/ooda.properties

# vbroker stuffs
wrapper.classpath=E:\vbroker\lib\vbjorb.jar
wrapper.classpath=E:\vbroker\lib\vbjapp.jar
wrapper.classpath=E:\vbroker\lib\vbjtools.jar
wrapper.classpath=E:\vbroker\lib\vbjcosnm.jar
# ooda-sample specific
wrapper.classpath=C:/ooda-sample/Studies/ibank/atmcs-i.jar
wrapper.classpath=C:/ooda-sample/Studies/classes/regex.jar

  and add ooda to 

zones=root

  to become

zones=root,ooda


Step 3. Mount OODA to the zone ooda and set up an alias by adding the following
  lines near the end of the file %JServ%/conf/JServ.conf
  (a few paragraphs before the line </IfModule> )

ApJServMount /OODA /ooda
Alias /ooda/ "C:/ooda-sample/Studies/"  <-- or other actual path in your machine

   (Mount name and zone name must be different.  They are case sensitive.  
    The strategy is to use uppercase name as mount name.  That way we can 
    put .gif, .htm etc. files in the servlet repository directory.  
    Servlets are accessed by /OODA/MyServlet, and regular files by 
    /ooda/myfigure.gif)

   (The alias for the repository directory must be different from mount name.
    Note the trailing "/".  If it is missing, you won't be able to find anything
    under it! The alias takes precedence over directory of same name under 
    document root.)

To bring up Apache Server, enter the following on a command line:

  net start apache

Note: you may need to stop it first with "net stop apache" if it
is already running.

Once the web server is running, you may enter the URL:

  http://localhost/ooda/default.htm

to reach the sample code home page.

Trouble Shooting:
  If you get "servlet /OODA/ibank.Main " not found.  It is probable
  that one of the above directory settings is not right (including
  the ones for the .jar files).
