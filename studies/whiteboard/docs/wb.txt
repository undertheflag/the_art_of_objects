............. Subtasks to be completed for V. 1.1: ...................

A certain port in a group may experience network problem during a
collaboration session. The program should detect this (using _non_existent()) 
and gracefully drops the port from the list or tries to reconnect to it. 

The DrawCanvas should distinguish markups sent by remote ports from the
ones drawn locally. This allows users to make markups locally while at
the same time participate in the collaboration.

Open associated cgm file when reading jpg, gif files.

Bounding box for a group of glyphs - should be the outer box
  instead of a small box ?

Free hand drawing with polyline (Glyph.java, Drawcanvas.java)

Polyline/Polygons, fill color option  (Glyph.java, Drawcanvas.java)

Use Powerpoint style drawing control (Drawcanvas.java)
  - chechbox group reset to pick button after mouse release
  - pick button groups glyphs when dragged
  - pick button moves the canvas when dragged with ctrl key
  - cut and paste, copy with ctrl key
  - paste - if a glyph already exists at the same location, shift the 
    new one a bit

Cursor change with function (move, resize, etc) (Drawcanvas.java)

Set tighter heights for labels (TextLine.java)

In hand mode, text input box shifted when the base image is shifted.

ESC to remove visible label box (Drawcanvas.java)

Resize + rotate glyphs (Glyph.java)

Graphic layer edit protection (Drawcanvas.java)

Multiple inset images (Drawcanvas.java, ImagePort)

Arrows, North Arrows (Glyph.java)

Predefined symbols (Glyph.java)

Implement the key management with a partition tree  (Drawcanvas.java)

Implement display level setting of NITF (Drawcanvas.java, ImagePort)

Grouping of glyphs in a selected region (Drawcanvas.java)

NITF compliance level enhancement (Nitf.cpp)
 - B/W images
 - synchronization code
 - blocking for large images
 - 12 bit images

Import/Export images in multiple formats using ImageMagic with burned
in overlays (Drawcanvas.java, ImagePort)

Write/read NITF with Jpeg compression for PC (jpeg/)

Graphic representation for lineWidth chooser (LineChooser)

Enhance Java Cgm class to read in and interpret generic cgm files
  - Turn on NITF font list in Cgm.java
  - pass canvas size to VDC extent

Nonpersistent overlays that won't be saved with files (like a thick arrow)
(Drawcanvas.java)



............. Subtasks completed after V. 1.0: ..................

Synchronize requestLeadership in control object.  - YTLau
Test the case of multiple leadership requests.  What if leadership
is granted to others before the next request?

Pop-up window for requesting leadership should time out in 5 seconds
and automatically grants leadership.  This avoids the problem of 
unattended port. - YTLau

Enforece policy for granting leadership - YTLau

Show list of ports before connect - YTLau

Fix bug with read when dir got changed.  - YTLau
  Files changed: Main.java

Make it work for reading nitf files without base image   - YTLau
  Files changed: DrawCanvas.java, Nitf.cpp, ImagePort.cpp

In hand mode, select base image first before dragging - YTLau

Pop up error message (Main.java) - YTLau

Give info when file format not recognized, avoid core dump - YTLau


............. Completed for V. 1.0: ..................

Image format supported:
 - Read: jpeg, gif, nitf (with or without base image), cgm
 - Write: nitf (with base image), cgm

V. 1.0 System design diagrams (wb.ppt) - YTLau
V. 1.0 release package (bytecode) for Solaris & PC (wb1_0.zip) - YTLau

Scrolling for large images (Drawcanvas.java) - YTLau
  - done with push hand, not scroll bars!

Cgm interpretor to current glyphs (Cgm.java) 
Import cgm file option menu (Cgm.java/ Main) - YTLau

Write/read NITF with cgm (Drawcanvas.java, ImagePort, Nitf.cpp)- YTLau

Write/read NITF with Jpeg compression (jpeg)- YTLau

Change attribute of selected glyphs (Drawcanvas.java) - YTLau
  - color, lineWidth, font

Export cgm file option menu (Cgm.java/ Main) - YTLau

Do not refresh when moving (Drawcanvas.java) - YTLau
  A dragging flag is added to control the image/glyph redraw.

Do not automatically select another one after deleting one (Drawcanvas.java)
  - YTLau

Better graphic Image buttons (*.gif) - YTLau

Line width 2 should not be the same as 1.  (Drawcanvas.java) - YTLau

For label, use one click to get text box (Drawcanvas.java) - YTLau

Limit fonts to those in NITF-CGM (Main.java) - YTLau

Make move box more visible (Drawcanvas.java) - YTLau
  Use background color as XORmode color.

Initial defaults for lineWidth, font, etc not consistent with those
display (Main.java) - YTLau

Erase all includes the base image. - YTLau

Tools converting glyphs to cgm (CgmTool.java) - YTLau
  (Minor enhancement may be needed)
