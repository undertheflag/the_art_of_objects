   jni.txt - Java Native Interface Description

ImagePort.java	Contains the image data structure and declare native calls
ImagePort.cpp   Contains the native methods that exchange data structure with
		jni/ImagePort.java
jni_ImagePort.h Generated from jni/ImagePort.java by javah

ImagePort.mdp	Project file for MS visual C++
ImagePort.mak	Makefile for generating libImagePort.so

Nitf.cpp	A class for NITF file in/out including cgm
Tiff.cpp	An image class with Tiff-like metadata
tiff.h		used by Tiff.cpp

ImagePort.dll   Dynamic link libraries for NT
libImagePort.so Dynamic link libraries for Unix (not included)

Other tools:

NITFSjpegcmp - NITF JPEG Image Compression Tool.  It compresses 
  the images inside an NITF file.  They are called by nitf/unpackimg.c
  (For Solaris Unix)

NITFSjpegdcmp - NITF JPEG Image De-compression Tool.  It de-compresses 
  the images inside an NITF file.   They are called by nitf/unpackimg.c
  (For Solaris Unix)

For native write(String) -

Do nm libxxx.so | grep write, if you see:

|FUNC |GLOB |0 |8 |Java_jni_ImagePort_write__FP7JNIEnv_P8_jobjectP8_jstring

then you need extern "C" around the functions.  The correct line should be:

|FUNC |GLOB |0    |8      |Java_jni_ImagePort_write

If a symbol is undefined, it looks like:

[308]   |         0|       0|NOTY |GLOB |0    |UNDEF  |write__4TiffPc
[314]   |         0|       0|NOTY |GLOB |0    |UNDEF  |_._4Tiff
[401]   |         0|       0|NOTY |GLOB |0    |UNDEF  |__4Tiffii
