This sample demonstrates the IDL code for Service and ServiceFactory.
The file build.bat invokes VisiBroker's IDL to Java converter, which
produces Java source code in the subdirectory "factory".  Only four
files are included here.  (The Holder and Helper classes are omitted.)

For a fully functional application using this interface definition,
please see studies\facotry in this package.
