# A capacity test that puts a lot of data into the database.
# To run with these data, do:
#    run test.odb test2.txt

# clean it up first
removeall

# invoke the test
test 1 10000

quit

			Test Result

			Size of DB file (b)

1 Dept x 1 Course		522
1 Dept x 1000 Course		50364	==> 50 b each course		
1 Dept x 10000 Course		509364	==> 51 b each course		

Note: There are a lot of repeated data inside test.odb.
  One may effectively shrink the database size with zip.
