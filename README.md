The sample code in this package is a supplement to the book
"The Art of Objects - Object-Oriented Design and Architecture",
by Yun-Tung Lau, Ph.D.

You may go through the code to understand the Java implementation of the
designs and architectures discussed in the book.  However, to gain a solid
understanding of the designs and to elevate yourself to the level of an
object designer or architect, careful reading and study of the book is
indispensable.

The package is organized into several chapter directories and one studies
directory.  The chapter directories correspond to the chapters in the book.
They contain sample code for the example design in the main text of the
book.  The studies directory contains source code for sample applications,
which are derived from the case studies and the sample designs in the book.

Please read the license file in this directory before using the software
package.
