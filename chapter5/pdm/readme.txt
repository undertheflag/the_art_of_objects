This sample demonstrates the IDL code for PDM and its mapping to
Java.  The file build.bat invokes VisiBroker's IDL to Java
converter, which produces Java source code in the subdirectory
"pdm".  Only four files are included here.  (The Holder and
Helper classes are omitted.)

For a fully functional application using this interface
definition, please see studies\pdm in this package.
